# Potential-Fishing-Zone-Analysis
Identification of potential fishing zones using machine learning, based on physical and chemical properties of the water.
## Description
Utilizing the remotely sensed data available from various satellites, Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), provides these advisories to the fishermen on a daily basis with specific references to fish landing centers along the Indian coast. However when these satellites do not work, there is no PFZ data for the fishermen, and they have to manually seacrh the oceans to find the fishing zone, which results in a waste of time, effort and resources. Hence, in such scenarios, we can use machine learning on past data for PFZ identification
